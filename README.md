# Introductory Lab 1
---

If you are reading this you have presumably followed the guide to get set up on Github and accept a Github Classroom assignment. Congrats! You've already figured out half of what we were looking to accomplish this first day in lab. 

One of the first things you will usually want to do after accepting an assignment is to download the assignment materials to your local system. If you haven't yet, read the section on downloading materials in the guide. To get some practice doing so, you should download the zip containing the contents of this lab (in Github's parlance, we call this a repository). Download this zip file, and then unzip it to a known location.

Once you have the files locally, then next step will generally be to edit them in some way. Once we start working with Python, you will likely use the VSCode editor to do so, but for today any editor that will open a `.txt` file will be perfectly fine. In this folder is a file called `Info.txt`. If you open it, you will see a series of questions with text in < > symbols at the end (eg: `<STUFF>`). Your task here is to answer each of the questions by deleting the text currently within the < > symbols and inserting your own text that answers the question. Once you have answered all the questions, save the file.

Finally, you need to upload the file back to Github! If you haven't yet read the section in the guide for uploading files, do so now. When you go to upload the file, just choose the file that you currently edited. There is no need to change the name or anything, as it will override the original version, which is what is desired. Give your upload (called a "commit" in Github's terminology) a description (eg: "Answered all questions"), and then commit it! All done!

_Note: You **CAN** edit this `Info.txt` directly online within Github itself. I would recommend that you do **NOT** do this however, as it will defeat the purpose of making sure you are comfortable both downloading and uploading content to Github. Moreover, trying to do so with actual code later in the semester is likely a recipe for disaster._

You are going to get really familiar with this process over the course of the semester. It will be both how template code is distributed to you for projects and how you will submit basically everything for scoring: lab exercises, problem sets, and projects.

When you are done, if you haven't already and are interested, you can look at the guide for installing Anaconda (Python) and VSCode on your own computer. Technically it is not required and you could use the computer lab computers, but many students find it far more convenient and easier having everything local on their own system. And it really isn't difficult to get up and running.
