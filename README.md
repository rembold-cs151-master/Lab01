# Practice Assignment
---

If you are reading this you have presumably followed the guide to get set up on GitHub and accept a GitHub Classroom assignment. Congrats! If you haven't also followed the guide to install Python and VSCode, go ahead and do that as well before continuing here.

One of the first things you will usually want to do after accepting an assignment is to download the assignment materials to your local system. If you haven't yet, watch the section on downloading materials in the guide. To get some practice doing so, you should download the zip containing the contents of this exercise (in GitHub's parlance, we call this a repository). Download this zip file, and then unzip it to a known location.

Once you have the files locally, then next step will generally be to edit them in some way. The easiest way to generally do this is to open VSCode, then from the File menu select "Open Folder", and select the _unzipped_ folder that you just made. You'll see all the contents of that folder then show up in the panel to the left. In this folder is a file called `Info.txt`. If you open it, you will see a series of questions with text in < > symbols at the end (eg: `<STUFF>`). Your task here is to answer each of the questions by deleting the text currently within the < > symbols and inserting your own text that answers the question. Once you have answered all the questions, save the file.

Finally, you need to upload the file back to GitHub! If you haven't yet read the section in the guide for uploading files, do so now. When you go to upload the file, just choose the file that you currently edited. There is no need to change the name or anything, as it will override the original version, which is what is desired. Give your upload (called a "commit" in Github's terminology) a description (eg: "Answered all questions"), and then commit it! All done!

_Note: You **CAN** edit this `Info.txt` directly online within Github itself. I would recommend that you do **NOT** do this however, as it will defeat the purpose of making sure you are comfortable both downloading and uploading content to Github. Moreover, trying to do so with actual code later in the semester is likely a recipe for disaster._
