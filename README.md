# Introductory Lab 1
---

If you are reading this you have presumably followed the guide to get set up on Github and learn how to download and upload files. Congrats! You've already figured out half of what we were looking to accomplish this first day in lab. 

To get practice uploading a file back to Github, in this folder is another file titled `Info.md`. Your task is to open that file (in whatever editor you like, plain old notepad would work fine) and substitute all the `<STUFF>` spaces with your own answers. I'm taking this opportunity to also learn a bit more about you, so this is both practice for you and informative for me. Once you have answered all the questions, save the file and upload it back to Github here as shown in the guide.

For most days in lab I will just check your work in person and not require you to upload finished work to Github. But all homework and the occasional lab will have work uploaded to Github, so today was practicing for that.

When you are done, if you haven't already and are interested, you can look at the guide for installing Anaconda (Python) on your own system. Totally not required for the class, but many may find it easier than having to come in to the lab.
