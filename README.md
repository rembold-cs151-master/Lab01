# Introductory Lab 1
---

If you are reading this you have presumably followed the guide to get set up on Github and learn how to download and upload files. Congrats! You've already figured out half of what we were looking to accomplish this first day in lab. 

To get practice downloading and uploading a file back to Github, in this folder is another file titled `Info.txt`. Your task is to download this repository, unzip it, open that file (in whatever editor you like, plain old notepad would work fine) and substitute everything between (and including) < > symbols (eg: `<STUFF>`) with your own answers. I'm taking this opportunity to also learn a bit more about you, so this is both practice for you and informative for me. Once you have answered all the questions, save the file and upload it back to Github here as shown in the guide.

_Note: You CAN edit this `Info.txt` directly online within Github itself. I would recommend that you do **NOT** do this however, as it will defeat the purpose of making sure you are comfortable both downloading and uploading content to Github._

You are going to get really familiar with this process over the course of the semester. It will be both how template code is distributed to you for projects and how you will submit basically everything for scoring: lab exercises, problem sets, and projects.

When you are done, if you haven't already and are interested, you can look at the guide for installing Anaconda (Python) on your own computer. Technically it is not required and you could use the computer lab computers, but many find it far more convenient and easier having everything local on their own system. And it really isn't difficult to get up and running.
